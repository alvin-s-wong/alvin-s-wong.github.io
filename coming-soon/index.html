        <p><em>It is <strong>Oct 11, 2024</strong> - it has been about 100 days since leaving my corporate tech leadership job to focus full-time on AI - the deploying, building of AI with AI and keeping up-to-date on the latest news and trends in our tech industry. I've so far launched a mini-SaaS startup (sitereviewdesk.ai) and am about to officially launch another one around realtime voice (earpiece.in) and hoping to build more products.</em></p><p><em>I thought I'd share in blog article form some of my current personal raw thoughts and perspective of my experience around AI disruption, my fears, the challenges I see for everyone in tech, startups and even economics and society in general.</em></p><p><em>I ended up having a lot to share. From one human to another here goes...</em></p><h2 id="your-personal-moat">Your Personal Moat?</h2><p>In an industry that seems to have developed a collective case of hyper-attention deficit disorder (ADHD), the challenge of finding a "stable" revenue stream grows more complex and uncertain each day. Moats—those protective barriers that once defined stability and uniqueness—are drying up at an alarming pace, eroded by the relentless march of artificial intelligence (AI). And no, this isn't just about Google or other big corporations being disrupted. It's about you and me—real people, particularly those of us in tech.</p><p>Consider the personal moats you've built over your career. Maybe it's a combination of your degree, your hard-earned skills, your ability to work well with others, and your knack for executing goals swiftly. These traits, once seen as valuable differentiators, are rapidly becoming commoditized. Put bluntly:</p><p><strong>Are you as essential to businesses today as you were a year ago?</strong></p><p><strong>And what about next year, when the next generation of AI agents is even more advanced? And the next year, and more as we race to AGI &amp; ASI?</strong></p><h2 id="is-the-ai-startup-grass-green">Is the AI-Startup Grass Green?</h2><p>If you're currently in your corporate job or personal financial and professional situation and feeling frustrated, you might be looking at the seemingly greener grass of the startup scene for answers, thinking it might be the next big meal ticket. Historians and economists will likely tell you that's right, that "technological displacement is nothing new—those displaced by innovation retrain, adapt, and create new opportunities."</p><p>However, I'd like to challenge that narrative. The rate of change we're witnessing is unprecedented.</p><h2 id="the-unprecedented-pace-of-ai-driven-change">The Unprecedented Pace of AI-Driven Change</h2><h3 id="why-is-this-time-different">Why is this time different?</h3><p>Where innovation once unfolded over years or decades, today we see entire industries transformed in weeks, even days. This is because it's not just acute to industries like lamp-lighting, horse and buggy manufacturing, or music sharing being disrupted. We're talking about the very foundation of what we as humans have leveraged to differentiate ourselves from one another, and from other species - intelligence.</p><p>In today's environment, by the time you bring a new idea near to market, it may already be obsolete. This isn't an exaggeration. With AI enabling faster development cycles, concepts are generated, tested, and surpassed at a blinding speed.</p><h3 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h3><p>I have 25 years of engineering experience all up and down the OSI model tech stack in my career and have run several engineering teams through the years. I have never seen the level of personal productivity and leverage a single person can wield today with AI and LLMs. What teams take weeks or months to plan, coordinate, implement, and test in sprints can be done in a day or less with only one person at the helm.</p><p>If you pull back, we can start all the way from identifying business problems, producing business plans, developing technical solutions, implementation, deployment -- going from proof-of-concept to production in weeks or even days if you templatize and keep your working prompts and patterns!</p><p>It is simultaneously exhilarating, exciting, but also eye-opening and scary as you think about the fact that you are not the only one wielding this capability.</p><h2 id="the-changing-landscape-of-work-and-startups">The Changing Landscape of Work and Startups</h2><h3 id="diminishing-need-for-human-involvement">Diminishing Need for Human Involvement</h3><p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has also spawned many no-code tools, lowering the barriers to entry and shortening the windows of startup opportunity.</p><p>On the one hand, we have ongoing swathes of engineers losing tech jobs due to all the efficiencies and automation. On the other hand, we're also seeing a trend of non-engineering professionals from other white-collar business roles like marketing, sales, product management, and more also starting to leverage and use the no-code or low barrier to entry LLM tools to compete and join the collective now to launch startups too.</p><p>This is all reading as a vicious cycle that will keep accelerating, causing oversupply and potentially diminishing returns. A huge amount of collective competition with supply and leapfrogging tech!</p><h3 id="the-adhd-and-leapfrogging-challenge-for-startups">The ADHD and Leapfrogging Challenge for Startups</h3><p>Startups aren't just racing to break even—they're racing to stay relevant!</p><p>Considering we're in the midst of a new "app explosion" akin to the early days of the Apple App Store, except this time, it's not limited to mobile applications. The "AI-ification" of every problem space is opening doors for new optimizations, with startups spun up faster than ever. With LLMs, pitch decks, proofs of concept (PoCs), and business plans can be generated in minutes, often with minimal human input.</p><p>Even venture capitalists (VCs)—the traditional champions of disruptive startups—struggle to keep pace and find signal in the noise with where to place their bets.</p><h2 id="the-reality-of-startup-valuations-and-success-rates">The Reality of Startup Valuations and Success Rates</h2><p>Sure, we see flashy headlines about startups achieving 8- or 9-figure valuations. $100M there, $500M here, $2B for frontier models, etc... but these numbers often reflect speculative future value rather than actual revenue or profitability.</p><p>Much of this capital deployment is based on analysts drinking their own hype Kool-Aid and being pressured with FOMO for themselves and the investors they represent.</p><p>Ultimately, one has to remember that all startups operate at significant losses. All businesses out of the gate burn through investment capital in hopes of capturing market share or making a breakthrough before their competitors—or before AI renders their offering obsolete. Which we've established earlier, will be more and more frequent as these opportunity windows get shorter and shorter daily.</p><h3 id="the-hard-truth-about-startup-success">The Hard Truth About Startup Success</h3><p>So back to the question. Will you, as a founder, be happy and enjoy this supposed greener grass as it relates to personal income streams and your livelihood?</p><p>Consider this fact: you're not going to magically be pocketing and cashing out these large venture capital sums of cash directly. In fact, the real financial rewards—if any—ONLY come from an exit strategy private sale or an IPO. And the probability of those happening is quite low.</p><p>According to a study by Startup Genome, 90% of startups fail[1]. That means less than 10% of startups survive long-term. This statistic has been consistent over the years, even as the technology landscape has evolved.</p><p>And with that risk, it is common for founders and CEOs of startups to make the same or less than their star employees in terms of "salary". A survey by Kruze Consulting found that the average startup CEO salary was $141,000 in 2024, which is often less than what top engineers or executives might make[2]. And for any overall compensation or "salary raises" - they typically have to go to the board to ask for approval or changes to the share structures in accordance? So really, this is no different than working in a regular corporate job where you ask your boss for a raise.</p><p>So while some unicorn startups break through, be wary of media hype reports. You only see the success stories. Most founders in the trenches live operating in a high-risk environment, often losing money for years before reaching profitability—if they ever do. VCs understand this risk; they know most of their bets are duds, and only a small percentage will make it big enough to recoup their overall investments. Definitely a daily mental fortitude and conviction thing to live through the Valley of Despair in Business.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="984" height="675" srcset="https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png 600w, https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png 984w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Take YouTube, for example. Despite its ubiquitous presence, it operated at a loss for several years before Google's deep pockets turned it profitable. [3] And that's a company that "made it".</p><p>Are you ready to do that? tl;dr Compete even harder with more competition, and your tech solution today may be sherlocked or obsolete by the time you see your first dollar of profit or sooner.</p><h2 id="the-human-element-so-what-can-we-do">The Human Element: So What Can We Do?</h2><p>With AI transforming the landscape so rapidly, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, even hopeless. Should you stay in your current non-AI job? Do you dive into entrepreneurship and AI proactively?</p><p>You might expect me to offer a list of "5 Top Things To Do to be Safe from AI disruption" or "How to Never be Replaced by AI". But the truth is, neither I nor anyone else can guarantee a silver bullet solution and path for you. If someone claims to -- be very wary!</p><p>For now, I would recommend reading "Who Moved My Cheese?" by Spencer Johnson if you haven't already. It's about adapting to shifts in one's environment and themes of different emotional responses and reactions to change, and which character you may be at this moment.</p><p>From there, here are some best-effort strategies I'm thinking of to embrace the future and shape it to our advantage as a society coexisting with AI. These ideas are a call to action, and I'll admit many come from AI brainstormed ideas themselves, or from concepts in the media that need greater tangible expansion. Let's explore them. Looking for feedback and your ideas!</p><h3 id="1-continuous-learning-and-adaptation">1. Continuous Learning and Adaptation</h3><p>The old model of "getting a degree, mastering a skill, and coasting through a stable career" is outdated. Those who commit to continuous learning as a way of life will be better positioned to navigate the future. AI tools that seem threatening can often be harnessed to enhance your own productivity.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Don't fear AI—embrace it. Go "all-in" and face the competition head-on. Take advantage of online courses and training in AI, machine learning, and automation tools. Familiarize yourself with these technologies and incorporate them to thrive in a human-AI hybrid workforce.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>All too often, I hear people light up when an LLM produces a coding error or a hallucination, celebrating that their jobs are safe. But all I see is denial—the early stage of grief. AI will improve faster than we can keep up. Dismissing it is akin to burying your head in the sand. Face this new reality head-on.</em></p><h3 id="2-emphasize-soft-skills-and-the-human-experience">2. Emphasize Soft Skills and the Human Experience</h3><p>While AI excels at technical tasks, it struggles (for now) with the nuanced, complex qualities that make us human. Creativity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and leadership remain in high demand—traits difficult for AI to replicate.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Invest in your soft skills. Focus on communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence. AI can't truly experience or simulate human interactions with the richness we do. This is an area where you can differentiate yourself and bring value to organizations.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>This will make you more valuable to both humans and organizations. I believe human control over decision-making—such as allocating resources—will remain a critical moral and legislative issue. We need to set boundaries on AI's role in key societal decisions.</em></p><h3 id="3-embrace-human-ai-collaboration">3. Embrace Human-AI Collaboration</h3><p>AI doesn't have to be the enemy—it can be a powerful tool to complement your own capabilities. By automating routine tasks, AI frees up your time for higher-order thinking, decision-making, and creative problem-solving.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Start leveraging AI tools to handle mundane, repetitive tasks. This will give you more bandwidth to focus on strategic, creative, or human-centered work. By collaborating with AI, you'll amplify your effectiveness rather than be replaced by it.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>Give AI the tedious, repetitive tasks that no one enjoys—like data entry, automated code reviews, or folding laundry. But let's draw a line when it comes to automating art or manipulating humans for greed or entertainment. If you're working in industries driven by those motives, think twice. Shame on those contributing to harmful trends for a quick buck.</em></p><h3 id="4-explore-opportunities-in-ai-ethics-and-regulation">4. Explore Opportunities in AI Ethics and Regulation</h3><p>As AI becomes more integrated into every aspect of our lives, the need for responsible, ethical AI governance grows. This presents a significant opportunity for humans to play a key role in shaping the future of AI.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> If you're passionate about responsible AI development, consider delving into AI ethics, safety, and regulation. This is an expanding field that will require strong human oversight to ensure AI benefits society in meaningful ways.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>The debate over capitalism, socialism, or any other "ism" should pivot toward elegant, efficient solutions for human governance in the AI age. Our societal structures need checks and balances to avoid being swayed by economics or profit alone. I want to see Nobel Prizes awarded for tackling human societal engineering in the AI era—not just technological advancements.</em></p><h3 id="5-build-a-support-network-and-seek-mentorship">5. Build a Support Network and Seek Mentorship</h3><p>Navigating this new landscape isn't something you or I should do alone. Building a network of professionals adapting to these changes can help you stay informed, share knowledge, and collaborate on solutions.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Engage with online communities, professional networks, and mentors who are grappling with the same AI-driven challenges. By learning from others' experiences, you'll be better equipped to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>Make real connections. Call people. Meet in person. Don't just like their posts on social media—engage in meaningful conversations. Give and receive honest feedback.</em></p><p><strong>Cautionary Note on Social Media:</strong> <em>Be skeptical of platforms like LinkedIn when it comes to authentic industry insights. Most posts focus on successes and shiny achievements. Negative feedback and misallocations of effort rarely see the light of day. What you're witnessing is a curated version of reality, often shaped by power dynamics. The world has lost objective journalism, and social media platforms are ill-suited to be our mental model builders. We need new models that promote societal care.</em></p><p><em>Hollywood used to create content that reinforced moral values and lessons for society—think of classic TV shows and movies that shaped our cultural norms. Today's fractured content landscape caters more to shock value and negativity. We're becoming a 24/7 audience of amusement bots. Someone needs to solve this problem—and that's where the next Nobel Prize should come from.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-future">Conclusion: Thriving in the AI-Driven Future</h2><p>Yes, the pace of AI development is daunting, and the disruption it causes is very real. No one knows how this will play out in the coming years, but humans have always done what we do best—adapt and persevere. We must learn to leverage these new tools and invest in our unique human strengths to not just survive but thrive in this AI-driven world.</p><p>The future belongs to those who can learn, unlearn, and relearn—those who remain curious, adaptable, and open to new ways of thinking. AI may reshape the landscape, but humans still have a critical role in steering that transformation and ensuring it benefits society as a whole. Now is the time to embrace that challenge and seize the opportunities it presents.</p><hr><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br>[1] Startup Genome. (2022).
