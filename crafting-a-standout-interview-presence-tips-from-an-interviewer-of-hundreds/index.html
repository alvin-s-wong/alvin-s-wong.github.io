            <h3 id=""></h3><p>What were some key patterns and subtleties that significantly influenced hiring decisions and candidates moving on to next-steps?  That is a question I often get asked.  After a long time on my to-do list, I am finally writing down my thoughts based my personal experience as a hiring manager and engineering leader having interviewed hundreds of engineering candidates through my career.</p><p><em>As we proceed, please know that I won't cover how to answer specific technical questions and l33t code type things. For brevity, let's just assume technical chops are sufficiently assessed elsewhere.</em></p><p>I’ll focus what things interviewees did that made the biggest impact on decision-makers but often get overlooked. Some play to the logical conscious side but many are important as they touch on our human subconscious side of our brains.</p><p><strong>Okay, let's jump into it!</strong>  Here are my personal tips and notes on what makes a candidate memorable going into interviews.  I hope it helps for anyone reading! (Including my future self as a reminder.)</p><hr><h3 id="the-basics-starting-on-the-right-foot"><strong>The Basics: Starting on the Right Foot</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Timeliness and Preparedness</strong><ul><li>Being a few minutes early shows respect for the interviewer’s time and avoids adding stress at the start of the call.</li><li>Setup your Zoom, Webex, Google Meet client etc... well ahead of time, make sure the camera and mic settings are working well</li></ul></li><li><strong>For remote calls - You are your video frame</strong><ul><li>Angle your camera so your eyes are at ~1/3rd down from the top of the overall image. Done right you should have your head and shoulders all visible.</li><li>Ideally you'll look straight into the lens of the camera during the call.  I know not always possible, but try and avoid looking at a monitor to your left or right not appearing to make eye-contact.</li><li>Ensure you’re well-lit on camera<ul><li>Use natural lighting by windows<br>or</li><li>Use a strong nearby light source.  Ideally a bright lamp/key-light at 45 deg from you, and is set pointing at your face just above your head</li></ul></li><li>Eliminate background visual distractions by using a virtual one or move to where you have a clean minimalist background.</li><li>Check that your audio is crisp, and eliminate risk of background noise (close that door/find a good spot in the house).</li></ul></li></ol><p>First impressions are subtle but powerful.  Coming across as prepared and professional immediately sets a good start to an engaging conversation.</p><hr><h3 id="energy-bring-your-best-self"><strong>Energy: Bring Your Best Self</strong></h3><p>One of the simplest but most effective ways to set yourself apart is through your energy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enthusiasm is Contagious</strong><br>Show genuine excitement for the role, the company, and the conversation. Enthusiasm demonstrates that you care about the opportunity and makes the conversation more enjoyable for both parties.</li><li><strong>Draw from Dale Carnegie’s Timeless Lessons</strong><br>The principles from <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> are classics for a reason. They work. Here are a few key takeaways that are invaluable for interviews:<ul><li><strong>Smile:</strong> A warm, natural smile puts both you and your interviewer at ease.</li><li><strong>Show Genuine Interest:</strong> Be sincerely curious about the role, the team, and the interviewer. You shouldn't need or feel like you're acting. Just think actively curiously about the person and team on the other side.</li><li><strong>Admit Mistakes:</strong> If you stumble or don’t know something, own it honestly and pivot back to what you can contribute. DO NOT try to lie, make excuses or make things up. It is easy to see right through these things and is an immediate red flag for seasoned interviewers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mirror and Match Energy</strong><br>Match the interviewer’s tone and energy, then elevate it slightly. If they’re low-energy, bring positivity without overdoing it; if they’re excited, match their enthusiasm.</li></ul><p>A little more energy on your part ensures you’ll stand out from others to the interviewer having to conduct a string of interviews.<br><br>Just like the old saying "the camera adds on 10lbs", the camera also somehow seems to reduce your energy by <strong>20%</strong>!  So don't be shy to add a bit more energy boost to compensate.</p><hr><h3 id="approach-interviews-as-a-collaboration"><strong>Approach Interviews as a Collaboration</strong></h3><p>Especially if you are nervous – the mindset you bring matters. This isn’t an adversarial “you vs. them” scenario or a hierarchical “boss vs. staff” situation. Approach it as a partnership: a conversation to discover if working together would create mutual success.</p><p>When you reframe the dynamic as a collaborative opportunity, it removes unnecessary pressure and fosters a more authentic connection.</p><hr><h3 id="response-strategy-clarity-wins"><strong>Response Strategy: Clarity Wins</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Direct and Focused Answers</strong><br>Stick to the point. Avoid going off on tangents, meandering or over-explaining. For engineering roles especially, do not feel the urge to fill in silences nervously by rambling. Thoughtful pauses and thoughtful clarification questions are better than rambling. Overall be thoughtful of the time and attention of the interviewer from their perspective.</li><li><strong>Structure Your Responses</strong><br>Use frameworks like <strong>STAR</strong> (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to deliver organized answers. This helps the interviewer follow your thought process and leaves a stronger impression.</li><li><strong>Honesty Over Guesswork</strong><br>Maybe the #1 tip of all. If you don’t know an answer NEVER MAKE things up. Best to admit you don't have that experience or skill set transparently. Most interviewers are more interested in how you think and how you approach problems than whether you know everything off the top of your head. Do not risk braking the little early trust your are just trying to build up with this new relationship.</li><li><strong>Problem-Solving Questions: Think Aloud</strong><ul><li>Rephrase the question to confirm your understanding. Important: Do not ever assume a question and rush through starting an answer before it is fully done being asked.</li><li>Walk through your thought process step by step.</li><li>Use examples from past experiences where possible, but it’s okay to suggest how you’d approach it based on what you know.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><h3 id="timeless-principles-for-connection-and-trust"><strong>Timeless Principles for Connection and Trust</strong></h3><p>One of the biggest differentiators in an interview is your ability to build rapport and establish trust. Here’s where even more Dale Carnegie principles shine:</p><ul><li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> Avoid interrupting or speaking over the interviewer. Listening well shows respect and attentiveness. (Tip: If you ever notice the interviewer wanting to interject or cut in, acknowledge that and pause and ask if they wanted to say something. DO not plow through obliviously. This is a big sign of respect and attentive interaction.)</li><li><strong>Use Their Name:</strong> This small habit makes the interaction more personal and engaging.</li><li><strong>Own Your Shortcomings:</strong> If you don’t have all the answers or make a mistake, be honest. Owning up gracefully builds credibility.</li><li><strong>Show Empathy:</strong> Acknowledge their perspective, especially if they express concerns about challenges you might face in the role.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="ending-strong-questions-that-leave-a-mark"><strong>Ending Strong: Questions That Leave a Mark</strong></h3><p>The questions you ask at the end of the interview are an opportunity to demonstrate your curiosity and alignment with the role. Here are a few examples of some of my favourite:</p><ul><li>What does success look like in this role in the first few months?</li><li>What challenges do you foresee for someone stepping into this position?</li><li>Can you tell me more about the team dynamic and how this role fits into it?</li><li>What’s the next step in the hiring process?</li></ul><p>Good questions show you’re thoughtful and serious about the opportunity while also giving you valuable insight into whether this is the right fit for you. It also subconsciously sets me as an interviewer picturing you in the role.</p><p>Avoid asking questions that purely focus on what the company can do for you at a hiring manager, team panel interview -- e.g. salary, bonus, perks, titles etc... Those aspects should have and typically be covered with other recruiter logistical calls if done right. Your goal is to understand the job, role, work arrangements for hiring manager and team panel interviews -- avoid appearing aggressive in seeking for what you can gain. Subtle art here, but right time for right conversations -- screening early or during the offer negotiations phase.</p><hr><h3 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3><p>A successful interview is more than just a technical Q&amp;A. It’s a chance to connect, build trust, and demonstrate that you’re someone the team can depend on. By focusing on preparation, energy, and interpersonal skills, you’ll elevate yourself from being just another competent candidate to someone they’ll remember and want to work with.</p><p><strong>Even if you don’t get the role, you’ve built a connection, and a positive impression can open doors within the company or with the interviewer in the future.</strong></p>
