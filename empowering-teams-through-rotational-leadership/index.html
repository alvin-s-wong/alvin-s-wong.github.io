            <p>Are you a leader who sometimes feels like a bottleneck in decision-making or in driving team initiatives? Wondering how you can build autonomy and nurture the next generation of leaders in your team? I’d like to share a practice I learned from multiple decades of being on teams as a member, tech lead and engineering leader and manager.  It is a practice that I found consistently brought about higher performance teams, greater engagement and sense of empowerment for each and every team member.  And most of all, a solid way to grow and foster the next generation of leaders.  Too good to be true?...  Its actually simple.</p><p><strong><u>The practice is rotating the facilitation of team rituals among members.</u></strong>   This could include everything from daily standups and sprint retrospectives to planning sessions and backlog grooming. Whether they’re new grads or seasoned engineers, everyone gets a chance to lead and contribute in new ways.</p><p>At this point, you may be asking "Alvin, does this not mean I am not doing my job team leader job by running these?"  Here's the answer.  No, believing that the team can only be successful if you make every decision, run every team meeting and "crack the whip" by pushing your title around is a trap and lack of confidence trope that new managers and leaders get wrong about what their role as a "leader" means.</p><p>The truth is that your role as a leader is not to be the irreplaceable "rockstar" of the team, smartest technical person or sole dictator of all tasks.  Your job is to be the coach, the music producer, the designer of processes to make every member shine and bring about and foster a healthy and cohesive team of highly motivated and engaged individuals that delivered consistently, sustainably and resiliently as a team.  The success of the team is the success of the leader.</p><p>So in this practice of rotating leadership rituals you are achieving this by way of getting the best engagement, sense of responsibility and creativity out of all members.  I.e. You will grow a team of leaders with high agency than a team of task assigned "workers".</p><p><strong>Why This Works</strong></p><p>Rituals are more than recurring meetings; they’re opportunities for growth, collaboration, and team bonding. Letting different team members lead these sessions provides fresh perspectives, encourages leadership skills, and strengthens the team’s collective resilience. As the manager, you maintain oversight, but allowing team members to shape these processes promotes initiative and keeps everyone thinking like a leader.</p><p>I’ve seen quieter members gain confidence and senior members develop the skill of guiding others. Instead of relying on just a few voices, the entire team shares responsibility, supporting whoever is leading and stepping in to keep things on track when needed. This not only raises the quality of decision-making but also builds camaraderie and alignment toward shared goals.</p><p><strong>How to Get Started</strong></p><p>Start small by rotating just one ritual. For instance, announce that standup facilitation will rotate alphabetically every sprint – by first name or by a sequence you think will be comfortable. Initially, you might start with senior team members, followed by intermediates, then juniors. Over time, you can settle on an order that’s comfortable for everyone or just keep it alphabetical for simplicity.</p><p>Once the team is comfortable with this, expand the practice to other rituals, like backlog grooming, retrospectives, and sprint planning. Keep in mind that some will jump at the chance to lead, while others may be more hesitant. Your role is to encourage balanced participation, making it safe for quieter voices to be heard. And for your senior team members, it’s a valuable opportunity with coaching and a lesson in fostering inclusivity, not just taking charge.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Worth It</strong></p><p>This practice can transform a group into a resilient, self-sufficient unit. Even if a few key members are unavailable, the team will have the capability to continue operating smoothly. As a manager, you’ll know the team can handle challenges on its own, allowing you to focus more on strategic planning and higher-level initiatives.</p><p>It’s also a pathway for future leaders. By rotating responsibilities, you’re not only supporting the current team but also preparing the next generation of tech leads and engineering managers. And yes, one of the side benefits is that, as they grow, you’ll have more time to focus on broader goals, knowing your team is empowered and dependable.</p><p>I hope this approach brings as much value to your team as it has to mine. If you’ve tried something similar or have insights to share, I’d love to hear them—let’s keep the conversation going on how we can best support and grow our teams.</p>
