I&apos;ve so far launched a mini-SaaS startup (sitereviewdesk.ai) and am about to officially launch another one around realtime voice (earpiece.in) and hoping to build more products.</em></p><p><em>I thought I&apos;d share in blog article form some of my current personal raw thoughts and perspective of my experience around AI disruption, my fears, the challenges I see for everyone in tech, startups and even economics and society in general.</em></p><p><em>I ended up having a lot to share. From one human to another here goes...</em></p><h2 id="your-personal-moat">Your Personal Moat?</h2><p>In an industry that seems to have developed a collective case of hyper-attention deficit disorder (ADHD), the challenge of finding a &quot;stable&quot; revenue stream grows more complex and uncertain each day. Moats&#x2014;those protective barriers that once defined stability and uniqueness&#x2014;are drying up at an alarming pace, eroded by the relentless march of artificial intelligence (AI). And no, this isn&apos;t just about Google or other big corporations being disrupted. It&apos;s about you and me&#x2014;real people, particularly those of us in tech.</p><p>Consider the personal moats you&apos;ve built over your career. Maybe it&apos;s a combination of your degree, your hard-earned skills, your ability to work well with others, and your knack for executing goals swiftly. These traits, once seen as valuable differentiators, are rapidly becoming commoditized. Put bluntly:</p><p><strong>Are you as essential to businesses today as you were a year ago?</strong></p><p><strong>And what about next year, when the next generation of AI agents is even more advanced? And the next year, and more as we race to AGI &amp; ASI?</strong></p><h2 id="is-the-ai-startup-grass-green">Is the AI-Startup Grass Green?</h2><p>If you&apos;re currently in your corporate job or personal financial and professional situation and feeling frustrated, you might be looking at the seemingly greener grass of the startup scene for answers, thinking it might be the next big meal ticket. Historians and economists will likely tell you that&apos;s right, that &quot;technological displacement is nothing new&#x2014;those displaced by innovation retrain, adapt, and create new opportunities.&quot;</p><p>However, I&apos;d like to challenge that narrative. The rate of change we&apos;re witnessing is unprecedented.</p><h2 id="the-unprecedented-pace-of-ai-driven-change">The Unprecedented Pace of AI-Driven Change</h2><h3 id="why-is-this-time-different">Why is this time different?</h3><p>Where innovation once unfolded over years or decades, today we see entire industries transformed in weeks, even days. This is because it&apos;s not just acute to industries like lamp-lighting, horse and buggy manufacturing, or music sharing being disrupted. We&apos;re talking about the very foundation of what we as humans have leveraged to differentiate ourselves from one another, and from other species - intelligence.</p><p>In today&apos;s environment, by the time you bring a new idea near to market, it may already be obsolete. This isn&apos;t an exaggeration. With AI enabling faster development cycles, concepts are generated, tested, and surpassed at a blinding speed.</p><h3 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h3><p>I have 25 years of engineering experience all up and down the OSI model tech stack in my career and have run several engineering teams through the years. I have never seen the level of personal productivity and leverage a single person can wield today with AI and LLMs. What teams take weeks or months to plan, coordinate, implement, and test in sprints can be done in a day or less with only one person at the helm.</p><p>If you pull back, we can start all the way from identifying business problems, producing business plans, developing technical solutions, implementation, deployment -- going from proof-of-concept to production in weeks or even days if you templatize and keep your working prompts and patterns!</p><p>It is simultaneously exhilarating, exciting, but also eye-opening and scary as you think about the fact that you are not the only one wielding this capability.</p><h2 id="the-changing-landscape-of-work-and-startups">The Changing Landscape of Work and Startups</h2><h3 id="diminishing-need-for-human-involvement">Diminishing Need for Human Involvement</h3><p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has also spawned many no-code tools, lowering the barriers to entry and shortening the windows of startup opportunity.</p><p>On the one hand, we have ongoing swathes of engineers losing tech jobs due to all the efficiencies and automation. On the other hand, we&apos;re also seeing a trend of non-engineering professionals from other white-collar business roles like marketing, sales, product management, and more also starting to leverage and use the no-code or low barrier to entry LLM tools to compete and join the collective now to launch startups too.</p><p>This is all reading as a vicious cycle that will keep accelerating, causing oversupply and potentially diminishing returns. A huge amount of collective competition with supply and leapfrogging tech!</p><h3 id="the-adhd-and-leapfrogging-challenge-for-startups">The ADHD and Leapfrogging Challenge for Startups</h3><p>Startups aren&apos;t just racing to break even&#x2014;they&apos;re racing to stay relevant!</p><p>Considering we&apos;re in the midst of a new &quot;app explosion&quot; akin to the early days of the Apple App Store, except this time, it&apos;s not limited to mobile applications. The &quot;AI-ification&quot; of every problem space is opening doors for new optimizations, with startups spun up faster than ever. With LLMs, pitch decks, proofs of concept (PoCs), and business plans can be generated in minutes, often with minimal human input.</p><p>Even venture capitalists (VCs)&#x2014;the traditional champions of disruptive startups&#x2014;struggle to keep pace and find signal in the noise with where to place their bets.</p><h2 id="the-reality-of-startup-valuations-and-success-rates">The Reality of Startup Valuations and Success Rates</h2><p>Sure, we see flashy headlines about startups achieving 8- or 9-figure valuations. $100M there, $500M here, $2B for frontier models, etc... but these numbers often reflect speculative future value rather than actual revenue or profitability.</p><p>Much of this capital deployment is based on analysts drinking their own hype Kool-Aid and being pressured with FOMO for themselves and the investors they represent.</p><p>Ultimately, one has to remember that all startups operate at significant losses. All businesses out of the gate burn through investment capital in hopes of capturing market share or making a breakthrough before their competitors&#x2014;or before AI renders their offering obsolete. Which we&apos;ve established earlier, will be more and more frequent as these opportunity windows get shorter and shorter daily.</p><h3 id="the-hard-truth-about-startup-success">The Hard Truth About Startup Success</h3><p>So back to the question. Will you, as a founder, be happy and enjoy this supposed greener grass as it relates to personal income streams and your livelihood?</p><p>Consider this fact: you&apos;re not going to magically be pocketing and cashing out these large venture capital sums of cash directly. In fact, the real financial rewards&#x2014;if any&#x2014;ONLY come from an exit strategy private sale or an IPO. And the probability of those happening is quite low.</p><p>According to a study by Startup Genome, 90% of startups fail[1]. That means less than 10% of startups survive long-term. This statistic has been consistent over the years, even as the technology landscape has evolved.</p><p>And with that risk, it is common for founders and CEOs of startups to make the same or less than their star employees in terms of &quot;salary&quot;. A survey by Kruze Consulting found that the average startup CEO salary was $141,000 in 2024, which is often less than what top engineers or executives might make[2]. And for any overall compensation or &quot;salary raises&quot; - they typically have to go to the board to ask for approval or changes to the share structures in accordance? So really, this is no different than working in a regular corporate job where you ask your boss for a raise.</p><p>So while some unicorn startups break through, be wary of media hype reports. You only see the success stories. Most founders in the trenches live operating in a high-risk environment, often losing money for years before reaching profitability&#x2014;if they ever do. VCs understand this risk; they know most of their bets are duds, and only a small percentage will make it big enough to recoup their overall investments. Definitely a daily mental fortitude and conviction thing to live through the Valley of Despair in Business.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="My Take on AI Disruption: The Challenges, the Opportunities, and My Hopes for the Future" loading="lazy" width="984" height="675" srcset="https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png 600w, https://alvin-s-wong.github.io/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-4.57.49-PM.png 984w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Take YouTube, for example. Despite its ubiquitous presence, it operated at a loss for several years before Google&apos;s deep pockets turned it profitable. [3] And that&apos;s a company that &quot;made it&quot;.</p><p>Are you ready to do that? tl;dr Compete even harder with more competition, and your tech solution today may be sherlocked or obsolete by the time you see your first dollar of profit or sooner.</p><h2 id="the-human-element-so-what-can-we-do">The Human Element: So What Can We Do?</h2><p>With AI transforming the landscape so rapidly, it&apos;s easy to feel overwhelmed, even hopeless. Should you stay in your current non-AI job? Do you dive into entrepreneurship and AI proactively?</p><p>You might expect me to offer a list of &quot;5 Top Things To Do to be Safe from AI disruption&quot; or &quot;How to Never be Replaced by AI&quot;. But the truth is, neither I nor anyone else can guarantee a silver bullet solution and path for you. If someone claims to -- be very wary!</p><p>For now, I would recommend reading &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; by Spencer Johnson if you haven&apos;t already. It&apos;s about adapting to shifts in one&apos;s environment and themes of different emotional responses and reactions to change, and which character you may be at this moment.</p><p>From there, here are some best-effort strategies I&apos;m thinking of to embrace the future and shape it to our advantage as a society coexisting with AI. These ideas are a call to action, and I&apos;ll admit many come from AI brainstormed ideas themselves, or from concepts in the media that need greater tangible expansion. Let&apos;s explore them. Looking for feedback and your ideas!</p><h3 id="1-continuous-learning-and-adaptation">1. Continuous Learning and Adaptation</h3><p>The old model of &quot;getting a degree, mastering a skill, and coasting through a stable career&quot; is outdated. Those who commit to continuous learning as a way of life will be better positioned to navigate the future. AI tools that seem threatening can often be harnessed to enhance your own productivity.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Don&apos;t fear AI&#x2014;embrace it. Go &quot;all-in&quot; and face the competition head-on. Take advantage of online courses and training in AI, machine learning, and automation tools. Familiarize yourself with these technologies and incorporate them to thrive in a human-AI hybrid workforce.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>All too often, I hear people light up when an LLM produces a coding error or a hallucination, celebrating that their jobs are safe. But all I see is denial&#x2014;the early stage of grief. AI will improve faster than we can keep up. Dismissing it is akin to burying your head in the sand. Face this new reality head-on.</em></p><h3 id="2-emphasize-soft-skills-and-the-human-experience">2. Emphasize Soft Skills and the Human Experience</h3><p>While AI excels at technical tasks, it struggles (for now) with the nuanced, complex qualities that make us human. Creativity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and leadership remain in high demand&#x2014;traits difficult for AI to replicate.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Invest in your soft skills. Focus on communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence. AI can&apos;t truly experience or simulate human interactions with the richness we do. This is an area where you can differentiate yourself and bring value to organizations.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>This will make you more valuable to both humans and organizations. I believe human control over decision-making&#x2014;such as allocating resources&#x2014;will remain a critical moral and legislative issue. We need to set boundaries on AI&apos;s role in key societal decisions.</em></p><h3 id="3-embrace-human-ai-collaboration">3. Embrace Human-AI Collaboration</h3><p>AI doesn&apos;t have to be the enemy&#x2014;it can be a powerful tool to complement your own capabilities. By automating routine tasks, AI frees up your time for higher-order thinking, decision-making, and creative problem-solving.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Start leveraging AI tools to handle mundane, repetitive tasks. This will give you more bandwidth to focus on strategic, creative, or human-centered work. By collaborating with AI, you&apos;ll amplify your effectiveness rather than be replaced by it.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>Give AI the tedious, repetitive tasks that no one enjoys&#x2014;like data entry, automated code reviews, or folding laundry. But let&apos;s draw a line when it comes to automating art or manipulating humans for greed or entertainment. If you&apos;re working in industries driven by those motives, think twice. Shame on those contributing to harmful trends for a quick buck.</em></p><h3 id="4-explore-opportunities-in-ai-ethics-and-regulation">4. Explore Opportunities in AI Ethics and Regulation</h3><p>As AI becomes more integrated into every aspect of our lives, the need for responsible, ethical AI governance grows. This presents a significant opportunity for humans to play a key role in shaping the future of AI.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> If you&apos;re passionate about responsible AI development, consider delving into AI ethics, safety, and regulation. This is an expanding field that will require strong human oversight to ensure AI benefits society in meaningful ways.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>The debate over capitalism, socialism, or any other &quot;ism&quot; should pivot toward elegant, efficient solutions for human governance in the AI age. Our societal structures need checks and balances to avoid being swayed by economics or profit alone. I want to see Nobel Prizes awarded for tackling human societal engineering in the AI era&#x2014;not just technological advancements.</em></p><h3 id="5-build-a-support-network-and-seek-mentorship">5. Build a Support Network and Seek Mentorship</h3><p>Navigating this new landscape isn&apos;t something you or I should do alone. Building a network of professionals adapting to these changes can help you stay informed, share knowledge, and collaborate on solutions.</p><p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Engage with online communities, professional networks, and mentors who are grappling with the same AI-driven challenges. By learning from others&apos; experiences, you&apos;ll be better equipped to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p><strong>Personal Hot-Take:</strong> <em>Make real connections. Call people. Meet in person. Don&apos;t just like their posts on social media&#x2014;engage in meaningful conversations. Give and receive honest feedback.</em></p><p><strong>Cautionary Note on Social Media:</strong> <em>Be skeptical of platforms like LinkedIn when it comes to authentic industry insights. Most posts focus on successes and shiny achievements. Negative feedback and misallocations of effort rarely see the light of day. What you&apos;re witnessing is a curated version of reality, often shaped by power dynamics. The world has lost objective journalism, and social media platforms are ill-suited to be our mental model builders. We need new models that promote societal care.</em></p><p><em>Hollywood used to create content that reinforced moral values and lessons for society&#x2014;think of classic TV shows and movies that shaped our cultural norms. Today&apos;s fractured content landscape caters more to shock value and negativity. We&apos;re becoming a 24/7 audience of amusement bots. Someone needs to solve this problem&#x2014;and that&apos;s where the next Nobel Prize should come from.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-future">Conclusion: Thriving in the AI-Driven Future</h2><p>Yes, the pace of AI development is daunting, and the disruption it causes is very real. No one knows how this will play out in the coming years, but humans have always done what we do best&#x2014;adapt and persevere. We must learn to leverage these new tools and invest in our unique human strengths to not just survive but thrive in this AI-driven world.</p><p>The future belongs to those who can learn, unlearn, and relearn&#x2014;those who remain curious, adaptable, and open to new ways of thinking. AI may reshape the landscape, but humans still have a critical role in steering that transformation and ensuring it benefits society as a whole. Now is the time to embrace that challenge and seize the opportunities it presents.</p><hr><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br>[1] Startup Genome. (2022).

In late June 2024, I made the hard decision to step away from my role as an Engineering Leader at Cisco. My goal? To dive headfirst and hands-on into the world of artificial intelligence and independently build a SaaS product from scratch.<strong>This is the story of how I brought </strong><a href="https://www.sitereviewdesk.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>sitereviewdesk.ai</strong></a><strong> to life in just 50 days.</strong>I share a sprint retrospective towards the bottom of this blog.<strong>Share on:</strong>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falvorithm.com%2Fblog%2Ff%2Ffrom-concept-to-launch-in-50-days%E2%80%94building-sitereviewdeskai&amp;title=From%20Concept%20to%20Launch%20in%2050%20Days%E2%80%94Building%20SiteReviewDesk.ai&amp;summary=Discover%20the%20journey%20of%20taking%20an%20idea%20from%20concept%20to%20launch%20in%2050%20days.%20Learn%20the%20process%2C%20challenges%2C%20and%20triumphs%20of%20building%20SiteReviewDesk.ai.&amp;source=AlvoRithm" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a></p><h3 id></h3><h3 id="the-need-for-speed-shifting-from-corporate-to-lean-execution">The Need for Speed: Shifting from Corporate to Lean Execution</h3><p>In the corporate environment, I found myself spending 80% or more of my time on meetings, status updates, and endless planning sessions. While coordination is essential in large organizations as a leader, it often leaves little room for actual personal tangible execution. I craved the agility of immediate decision-making and the thrill of rapid development.I aimed to invert my daily ratio to an extreme of 90% execution and 10% planning. This approach was inspired by the military&apos;s 2/3rd rule: spend one-third of the time planning and allocate the remaining two-thirds to execution. As an independent developer, this was not just possible&#x2014;it was imperative.  My challenge to myself and goal was to maximize learning and building with what I had left of summer 2024.  I had planned at the time to re-evaluate in late September on next-steps for me -- so that was my personal &quot;deadline&quot;.</p><h3 id="-1"></h3><h3 id="hands-on-learning-the-best-teacher">Hands-On Learning: The Best Teacher</h3><p>While I began with some courses from DeepLearning.ai, I have always preferred and know myself that I resonated more with hands-on application. That always seemed to stick better with me as I get into my 3rd decade of my career.  For me at least, building, tinkering, and even stumbling along the way provided insights that no lecture could offer. I believe that real understanding comes from doing, not just listening and trying to absorb an inventory of theory and knowledge that I might or might not use later.</p><h3 id="the-birth-of-sitereviewdeskai">The Birth of SiteReviewDesk.ai</h3><p>I started jotting down AI-based startup ideas that were both fun and potentially impactful. I wanted to solve real problems, even if they were old issues that could benefit from new solutions. That&apos;s when the idea for <a href="https://sitereviewdesk.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitereviewdesk.ai </a>crystallized&#x2014;a service that automates website reviews using AI, providing deep insights and recommendations for better engagement.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/7be58955-43b3-42d5-b773-7bfca29359bc/Screenshot%202024-09-25%20at%201.08.53%E2%80%AFPM.png/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" class="kg-image" alt="From Concept to Launch in 50 Days&#x2014;Building SiteReviewDesk.ai" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="722"></figure><hr><h4 id="50-day-retrospective">50-Day Retrospective</h4><h3 id="what-went-well">What Went Well</h3><ul><li><strong>Morning Stand-ups:</strong> I began each day with a 10-minute personal stand-up meeting. This practice helped me jot-down top priorities, move previous day missed tasks and goals to today if it made sense, and adjust to any new developments overnight quickly.</li><li><strong>Prioritizing Impact:</strong> Focusing on big-impact tasks over minor distractions kept the project on track. It&#x2019;s easy to get lost in the weeds; staying focused on the core functionality was key.</li><li><strong>Daily Commits:</strong> Ending each day with a final commit to the main branch created a satisfying sense of progress and ensured that nothing was left hanging.  Each day&apos;s batch of edits and rabbit holes can get gnarly, but just like a relationship with a spouse -- try to never go to bed upset or leaving things messy :).</li><li><strong>Establishing an AI Project Masterplan.md</strong>: Something I picked up from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bhancock_ai?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code with Brandon</a>&apos;s template <a href="https://github.com/bhancockio/claude-crash-course-templates?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> was invaluable as a way to build and maintain a sort of master project plan that you can maintain and give to any LLM for context on your project.  This is so you don&apos;t have to re-explain to LLMs over and over again what exactly you&apos;re doing and the context.  I just put this file in my Anthropic project file cache for example, or kept pointing to it in Cursor/VSCode for the LLMs to read first as a primer before answering and working on my code.</li><li><strong>Optimizing AI Tools:</strong> Making it a good habit to keep updating these system/agent prompt engineering and context documents frequently was good hygiene and significantly improved the efficiency using AI development tools. Files like the masterplan.md file, a db schema description file, project file folder structure explainer and README.md for the repo were key.  This all helped reduced the time spent on iterative messaging the LLMs and increased the quality of their outputs.</li><li><strong>Choosing the Right AI Tools:</strong> I found that <a href="https://www.cursor.com/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursor</a> outperformed VS Code with the <a href="https://www.continue.dev/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continue</a> extension for my needs. Additionally, <a href="https://ollama.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ollama</a> was fantastic for experimenting with different models locally without worrying about API costs.  During development I probably did 80% of LLM API calls using Ollama (Llama 3.1) and 20% on production paid models Gemini, GPT 4O, Sonnet 3.5 etc..</li></ul><h3 id="challenges-faced">Challenges Faced</h3><ul><li><strong>Tool Limitations:</strong> While using Anthropic&apos;s Project feature, I encountered issues with updating files. The inability to replace files with the same name led to confusion about which version the AI was referencing.  I notified Anthropic about this key functionality miss btw.  Maybe others have too!</li><li><strong>Platform Complexity:</strong> Running everything on Google Firebase and GCP was more convoluted than expected. The separate admin consoles and scattered documentation made navigation and troubleshooting time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Documentation Woes:</strong> Google&apos;s documentation was less user-friendly than I had hoped. I often resorted to using language models to find answers, which isn&apos;t ideal when you&apos;re deep in development.</li></ul><h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3><ul><li><strong>Avoid Manual Copy-Pasting:</strong> Early on, I wasted time manually transferring code snippets from AI chat windows. F**k that -- don&apos;t be like me and do that.  Switching to Cursor streamlined this process, integrating AI suggestions directly into my codebase.  That&apos;s one of the things they forked and implemented into their core editor with better fuzzy logic to inject lines of code more accurately.  Continue.dev with the limitations of being a VS Code extension didn&apos;t do as smooth of a job with this.  I haven&apos;t tried and done the latest track test with VS Code&apos;s latest releases to try and compete with Cursor on this.</li><li><strong>Select the Right Models:</strong> General-purpose models like Llama 3.1 didn&apos;t meet my coding needs.

This skill can make your coding workflow smoother and more efficient.<strong>The Power of Multi-Occurrence Selection</strong>Multi-occurrence selection allows you to select and edit multiple instances of text simultaneously. This feature is incredibly useful when you need to make repetitive changes across your codebase. Whether you&apos;re converting brackets to parentheses or reformatting text into CSV, multi-occurrence selection can save you significant time and effort.<strong>Watch the 2-minute Full Tutorial:</strong>I demonstrate multi-occurrence selection in action.

Life was good, right? Well, it was... but if you&apos;re anything like me, an engineer at heart, something was missing over time. That spark, that fire in my belly that made me fall in love with tech 20+ years ago.So, I did what any rational person would do. <strong>I quit my job. &#x1F605;</strong>Crazy? Maybe. Exciting? Absolutely!  <strong>Let&apos;s talk about it...</strong><em>(Thanks for reading! &#x1F60A; I share all this openly with the hope that it helps <strong>you</strong> with your life and pursuits, both in work and your passion for your craft. May it offer at least one tech industry colleague&apos;s experience for your consideration.)</em>Share on  <strong>LinkedIn</strong> </p><h4 id="a-leap-of-faith">A Leap of Faith</h4><p></p><p>I worked at Cisco for about a decade since the acquisition of OpenDNS in 2015 - the hot security startup I had joined back then. Over the years, I gathered a ton of experience across several teams and roles, including Security Engineer, Network Engineer, Software Engineer, Technical Lead, and Senior Tech Lead.As I gained more seniority and leadership experience, I naturally moved into leadership roles and became part of the senior levels of Engineering Management, stepping in wherever our business needed me. I was fortunate to join, start, hire, and lead teams, working with a ton of smart, awesome people, and together we delivered on some impactful projects.My career in a big tech giant was going well, and the momentum of the business cycles was fulfilling. But deep down, perhaps like some of you in the industry reading this blog, I gradually found it more difficult to extricate myself from necessary but lengthy corporate processes, meetings, and management tasks. I longed to spend personal time on immediate hands-on exploration and building things directly.I loved my team, and fostering their teamwork and growth is something I will cherish forever. However, what was best for the team often trumped my desire to spend time coding and building directly. <strong>As it should, and I would pick them over me any day of the week.</strong>With my deep passion and obsession with the AI/ML explosion, I came to a realization. <strong>I needed a change to follow my heart and pursue more exploration into AI/ML adoption.</strong> I wanted to learn and develop directly, something I had been obsessed about lately.After discussing with my family and ensuring I could survive for several months, I made a hard decision and took a leap of faith. <strong>I decided to swing the pendulum back to being hands-on by taking 3-6 months away from a traditional &quot;day job&quot; to learn everything I could about AI/ML.</strong> I aimed to understand how to work with it, how to code with it, how to develop content and business strategies with it, and ultimately how to build a startup with it.Yes, call me crazy &#x1F61C;, but I&apos;m simultaneously juggling studying, coding, and building while maintaining my business and leadership skills through a solo-preneur startup project. <strong>Let&apos;s see how far and fast AI can take us as a force multiplier!</strong> &#x1F680;<em>(Spoiler alert: <strong>It&apos;s only been 3 weeks, and I&apos;ve never been more productive, excited, and focused.</strong> Working long and hard with new tooling and tech, co-developing and brainstorming with LLMs, this is a huge upgrade in personal satisfaction. Life&apos;s good &#x1F60A;.)</em></p><h4 id="discovering-alvorithm">Discovering AlvoRithm</h4><p></p><p>During this transition, I felt I needed a new face and brand to reinvent myself.  I&apos;ve decided on the <strong>AlvoRithm</strong>.  AlvoRithm will be a personal brand dedicated to sharing my journey, insights, and discoveries in AI. It&#x2019;s a play on words, combining my passions for music production, video content creation, and more. AlvoRithm is not just a platform for documenting my experiences; it&#x2019;s also a space where I aim to inspire and educate others who are passionate about technology and creativity.<strong>AlvoRithm&apos;s mission is to bridge the gap between AI theory and practical application, providing valuable insights to software developers, tech professionals, aspiring engineers, and anyone interested in the future of technology.</strong> Through blogs, vlogs, and social media, I share weekly updates in a Sprint retrospective style, highlighting what went well, what I learned, and areas for improvement.</p><h4 id="learning-and-growing">Learning and Growing</h4><p>My journey into AI has been incredibly enriching over the last three weeks. I&apos;m currently diving deep into Deep Learning Specialization courses from Coursera with Andrew Ng from Stanford University. These courses provide a solid theoretical foundation and practical skills essential for navigating the AI landscape.In parallel, I&apos;m working on a startup idea that leverages AI to create innovative solutions. This hands-on project allows me to experiment with the latest LLM models, cutting-edge techniques, and applications for software development. It&apos;s an exhilarating process that combines creativity, technical expertise, and a passion for problem-solving.</p><h4 id="sharing-knowledge">Sharing Knowledge</h4><p>One of my core beliefs is that knowledge should be shared. Through AlvoRithm, I aim to distill complex AI concepts into easily digestible content. My goal is to save you time and provide you with the most valuable insights from a seasoned tech industry professional.I can start with going over what I believe every tech enthusiast should explore in order:</p><ol><li><strong>Conversational AI</strong>: Engage with chat models like OpenAI&apos;s GPT-4 or Anthropic&apos;s Claude.</li><li><strong>Image Generation</strong>: Experiment with tools like DALL-E, Midjourney for generating images or equivalent.</li><li><strong>Foundational Concepts</strong>: Understand key AI terms and concepts (e.g. LLMs, Supervised, Unsupervised, Parameters, Quantization, Fine-Tuning, context-windows, temperature, RAG, multi-modal, agents.</li><li><strong>Coding Assistants</strong>: Integrate the latest code workflow enhancing tools (e.g. Github CoPilot, Agentic Frameworks like Crew.ai or Autogen).</li><li><strong>Local Hosting</strong>: Explore local LLM hosting alternatives and open-source models.</li><li><strong>Popular Models</strong>: Try out various open-source models (e.g. LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma 2) vs paid models (ChatGPT, Claude)</li></ol><h4 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h4><p>As I continue this exciting journey, I&apos;m committed to launching at least one new startup around September, centered around an AI-based application I&apos;m passionate about and I&apos;ll be using AI itself to help accelerate and implement the service. AlvoRithm will be the hub where I share every step of this journey, offering insights, lessons learned, and inspiration to my audience.</p><h4 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h4><p>If you&apos;re intrigued by my journey and want to stay updated and keep in touch on the latest in AI, tech, and creative content, I invite you to follow me:- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvinswong/- YouTube: AlvoRithm - YouTube channel - X.com (Twitter) - @theAlvoRithmLet&apos;s explore together!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
