That is a question I often get asked.  After a long time on my to-do list, I am finally writing down my thoughts based my personal experience as a hiring manager and engineering leader having interviewed hundreds of engineering candidates through my career.</p><p><em>As we proceed, please know that I won&apos;t cover how to answer specific technical questions and l33t code type things. For brevity, let&apos;s just assume technical chops are sufficiently assessed elsewhere.</em></p><p>I&#x2019;ll focus what things interviewees did that made the biggest impact on decision-makers but often get overlooked. Some play to the logical conscious side but many are important as they touch on our human subconscious side of our brains.</p><p><strong>Okay, let&apos;s jump into it!</strong>  Here are my personal tips and notes on what makes a candidate memorable going into interviews.  I hope it helps for anyone reading! (Including my future self as a reminder.)</p><hr><h3 id="the-basics-starting-on-the-right-foot"><strong>The Basics: Starting on the Right Foot</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Timeliness and Preparedness</strong><ul><li>Being a few minutes early shows respect for the interviewer&#x2019;s time and avoids adding stress at the start of the call.</li><li>Setup your Zoom, Webex, Google Meet client etc... well ahead of time, make sure the camera and mic settings are working well</li></ul></li><li><strong>For remote calls - You are your video frame</strong><ul><li>Angle your camera so your eyes are at ~1/3rd down from the top of the overall image. Done right you should have your head and shoulders all visible.</li><li>Ideally you&apos;ll look straight into the lens of the camera during the call.  I know not always possible, but try and avoid looking at a monitor to your left or right not appearing to make eye-contact.</li><li>Ensure you&#x2019;re well-lit on camera<ul><li>Use natural lighting by windows<br>or</li><li>Use a strong nearby light source.  Ideally a bright lamp/key-light at 45 deg from you, and is set pointing at your face just above your head</li></ul></li><li>Eliminate background visual distractions by using a virtual one or move to where you have a clean minimalist background.</li><li>Check that your audio is crisp, and eliminate risk of background noise (close that door/find a good spot in the house).</li></ul></li></ol><p>First impressions are subtle but powerful.  Coming across as prepared and professional immediately sets a good start to an engaging conversation.</p><hr><h3 id="energy-bring-your-best-self"><strong>Energy: Bring Your Best Self</strong></h3><p>One of the simplest but most effective ways to set yourself apart is through your energy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enthusiasm is Contagious</strong><br>Show genuine excitement for the role, the company, and the conversation. Enthusiasm demonstrates that you care about the opportunity and makes the conversation more enjoyable for both parties.</li><li><strong>Draw from Dale Carnegie&#x2019;s Timeless Lessons</strong><br>The principles from <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> are classics for a reason. They work. Here are a few key takeaways that are invaluable for interviews:<ul><li><strong>Smile:</strong> A warm, natural smile puts both you and your interviewer at ease.</li><li><strong>Show Genuine Interest:</strong> Be sincerely curious about the role, the team, and the interviewer. You shouldn&apos;t need or feel like you&apos;re acting. Just think actively curiously about the person and team on the other side.</li><li><strong>Admit Mistakes:</strong> If you stumble or don&#x2019;t know something, own it honestly and pivot back to what you can contribute. DO NOT try to lie, make excuses or make things up. It is easy to see right through these things and is an immediate red flag for seasoned interviewers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mirror and Match Energy</strong><br>Match the interviewer&#x2019;s tone and energy, then elevate it slightly. If they&#x2019;re low-energy, bring positivity without overdoing it; if they&#x2019;re excited, match their enthusiasm.</li></ul><p>A little more energy on your part ensures you&#x2019;ll stand out from others to the interviewer having to conduct a string of interviews.<br><br>Just like the old saying &quot;the camera adds on 10lbs&quot;, the camera also somehow seems to reduce your energy by <strong>20%</strong>!  So don&apos;t be shy to add a bit more energy boost to compensate.</p><hr><h3 id="approach-interviews-as-a-collaboration"><strong>Approach Interviews as a Collaboration</strong></h3><p>Especially if you are nervous &#x2013; the mindset you bring matters. This isn&#x2019;t an adversarial &#x201C;you vs. them&#x201D; scenario or a hierarchical &#x201C;boss vs. staff&#x201D; situation. Approach it as a partnership: a conversation to discover if working together would create mutual success.</p><p>When you reframe the dynamic as a collaborative opportunity, it removes unnecessary pressure and fosters a more authentic connection.</p><hr><h3 id="response-strategy-clarity-wins"><strong>Response Strategy: Clarity Wins</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Direct and Focused Answers</strong><br>Stick to the point. Avoid going off on tangents, meandering or over-explaining. For engineering roles especially, do not feel the urge to fill in silences nervously by rambling. Thoughtful pauses and thoughtful clarification questions are better than rambling. Overall be thoughtful of the time and attention of the interviewer from their perspective.</li><li><strong>Structure Your Responses</strong><br>Use frameworks like <strong>STAR</strong> (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to deliver organized answers. This helps the interviewer follow your thought process and leaves a stronger impression.</li><li><strong>Honesty Over Guesswork</strong><br>Maybe the #1 tip of all. If you don&#x2019;t know an answer NEVER MAKE things up. Best to admit you don&apos;t have that experience or skill set transparently. Most interviewers are more interested in how you think and how you approach problems than whether you know everything off the top of your head. Do not risk braking the little early trust your are just trying to build up with this new relationship.</li><li><strong>Problem-Solving Questions: Think Aloud</strong><ul><li>Rephrase the question to confirm your understanding. Important: Do not ever assume a question and rush through starting an answer before it is fully done being asked.</li><li>Walk through your thought process step by step.</li><li>Use examples from past experiences where possible, but it&#x2019;s okay to suggest how you&#x2019;d approach it based on what you know.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><h3 id="timeless-principles-for-connection-and-trust"><strong>Timeless Principles for Connection and Trust</strong></h3><p>One of the biggest differentiators in an interview is your ability to build rapport and establish trust. Here&#x2019;s where even more Dale Carnegie principles shine:</p><ul><li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> Avoid interrupting or speaking over the interviewer. Listening well shows respect and attentiveness. (Tip: If you ever notice the interviewer wanting to interject or cut in, acknowledge that and pause and ask if they wanted to say something. DO not plow through obliviously. This is a big sign of respect and attentive interaction.)</li><li><strong>Use Their Name:</strong> This small habit makes the interaction more personal and engaging.</li><li><strong>Own Your Shortcomings:</strong> If you don&#x2019;t have all the answers or make a mistake, be honest. Owning up gracefully builds credibility.</li><li><strong>Show Empathy:</strong> Acknowledge their perspective, especially if they express concerns about challenges you might face in the role.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="ending-strong-questions-that-leave-a-mark"><strong>Ending Strong: Questions That Leave a Mark</strong></h3><p>The questions you ask at the end of the interview are an opportunity to demonstrate your curiosity and alignment with the role. Here are a few examples of some of my favourite:</p><ul><li>What does success look like in this role in the first few months?</li><li>What challenges do you foresee for someone stepping into this position?</li><li>Can you tell me more about the team dynamic and how this role fits into it?</li><li>What&#x2019;s the next step in the hiring process?</li></ul><p>Good questions show you&#x2019;re thoughtful and serious about the opportunity while also giving you valuable insight into whether this is the right fit for you. It also subconsciously sets me as an interviewer picturing you in the role.</p><p>Avoid asking questions that purely focus on what the company can do for you at a hiring manager, team panel interview -- e.g. salary, bonus, perks, titles etc... Those aspects should have and typically be covered with other recruiter logistical calls if done right. Your goal is to understand the job, role, work arrangements for hiring manager and team panel interviews -- avoid appearing aggressive in seeking for what you can gain. Subtle art here, but right time for right conversations -- screening early or during the offer negotiations phase.</p><hr><h3 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3><p>A successful interview is more than just a technical Q&amp;A. It&#x2019;s a chance to connect, build trust, and demonstrate that you&#x2019;re someone the team can depend on. By focusing on preparation, energy, and interpersonal skills, you&#x2019;ll elevate yourself from being just another competent candidate to someone they&#x2019;ll remember and want to work with.</p><p><strong>Even if you don&#x2019;t get the role, you&#x2019;ve built a connection, and a positive impression can open doors within the company or with the interviewer in the future.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Empowering Teams Through Rotational Leadership]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Are you a leader who sometimes feels like a bottleneck in decision-making or in driving team initiatives?

Wondering how you can build autonomy and nurture the next generation of leaders in your team? I&#x2019;d like to share a practice I learned from multiple decades of being on teams as a member, tech lead and engineering leader and manager.  It is a practice that I found consistently brought about higher performance teams, greater engagement and sense of empowerment for each and every team member.  And most of all, a solid way to grow and foster the next generation of leaders.  Too good to be true?...  Its actually simple.</p><p><strong><u>The practice is rotating the facilitation of team rituals among members.</u></strong>   This could include everything from daily standups and sprint retrospectives to planning sessions and backlog grooming. Whether they&#x2019;re new grads or seasoned engineers, everyone gets a chance to lead and contribute in new ways.</p><p>At this point, you may be asking &quot;Alvin, does this not mean I am not doing my job team leader job by running these?&quot;  Here&apos;s the answer.  No, believing that the team can only be successful if you make every decision, run every team meeting and &quot;crack the whip&quot; by pushing your title around is a trap and lack of confidence trope that new managers and leaders get wrong about what their role as a &quot;leader&quot; means.</p><p>The truth is that your role as a leader is not to be the irreplaceable &quot;rockstar&quot; of the team, smartest technical person or sole dictator of all tasks.  Your job is to be the coach, the music producer, the designer of processes to make every member shine and bring about and foster a healthy and cohesive team of highly motivated and engaged individuals that delivered consistently, sustainably and resiliently as a team.  The success of the team is the success of the leader.</p><p>So in this practice of rotating leadership rituals you are achieving this by way of getting the best engagement, sense of responsibility and creativity out of all members.  I.e. You will grow a team of leaders with high agency than a team of task assigned &quot;workers&quot;.</p><p><strong>Why This Works</strong></p><p>Rituals are more than recurring meetings; they&#x2019;re opportunities for growth, collaboration, and team bonding. Letting different team members lead these sessions provides fresh perspectives, encourages leadership skills, and strengthens the team&#x2019;s collective resilience. As the manager, you maintain oversight, but allowing team members to shape these processes promotes initiative and keeps everyone thinking like a leader.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve seen quieter members gain confidence and senior members develop the skill of guiding others. Instead of relying on just a few voices, the entire team shares responsibility, supporting whoever is leading and stepping in to keep things on track when needed. This not only raises the quality of decision-making but also builds camaraderie and alignment toward shared goals.</p><p><strong>How to Get Started</strong></p><p>Start small by rotating just one ritual. For instance, announce that standup facilitation will rotate alphabetically every sprint &#x2013; by first name or by a sequence you think will be comfortable. Initially, you might start with senior team members, followed by intermediates, then juniors. Over time, you can settle on an order that&#x2019;s comfortable for everyone or just keep it alphabetical for simplicity.</p><p>Once the team is comfortable with this, expand the practice to other rituals, like backlog grooming, retrospectives, and sprint planning. Keep in mind that some will jump at the chance to lead, while others may be more hesitant. Your role is to encourage balanced participation, making it safe for quieter voices to be heard. And for your senior team members, it&#x2019;s a valuable opportunity with coaching and a lesson in fostering inclusivity, not just taking charge.</p><p><strong>Why It&#x2019;s Worth It</strong></p><p>This practice can transform a group into a resilient, self-sufficient unit. Even if a few key members are unavailable, the team will have the capability to continue operating smoothly. As a manager, you&#x2019;ll know the team can handle challenges on its own, allowing you to focus more on strategic planning and higher-level initiatives.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also a pathway for future leaders. By rotating responsibilities, you&#x2019;re not only supporting the current team but also preparing the next generation of tech leads and engineering managers. And yes, one of the side benefits is that, as they grow, you&#x2019;ll have more time to focus on broader goals, knowing your team is empowered and dependable.</p><p>I hope this approach brings as much value to your team as it has to mine. If you&#x2019;ve tried something similar or have insights to share, I&#x2019;d love to hear them&#x2014;let&#x2019;s keep the conversation going on how we can best support and grow our teams.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decisions: The Ultimate Artifact of Leadership]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>A leader&#x2019;s decision is the most valuable artifact they can contribute on behalf of the team.

Shared thoughtfully, it can make or break a team&#x2019;s success. As leaders, we should be deeply invested in the process of producing these decisions&#x2014;not just in the outcomes but in how we arrive at them and communicate them.</em></p><p>One of the greatest responsibilities and honours, you have as a leader is making decisions. At some point in your career, you&#x2019;ve proven a track record of good decisions, coupled with the ability to quickly course-correct and learn from the not-so-good ones. This earned you the trust of your organization, granting you more say in the critical paths, major projects, and strategic initiatives that shape its future.</p><p>But decision-making isn&#x2019;t simply about choosing outcomes. It&#x2019;s a process that deserves careful attention and structure, especially as the choices multiply. Let&#x2019;s break down decision-making into practical steps: What types of decisions are there? Which frameworks or mental patterns can help us with each? And how much time, effort, or data should we invest in each type? These questions matter because, as leaders, we&#x2019;re faced with a relentless stream of decisions, big and small, every day.</p><h3 id="reversible-vs-irreversible-decisions">Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions</h3><p>The first key distinction is between reversible and difficult-to-reverse decisions. This question sets the foundation for how you approach any choice. For reversible decisions, you can afford more flexibility, encouraging swift progress and embracing an iterative approach. If the decision turns out wrong, you can pivot with minimal cost.</p><p>However, if the decision has lasting implications, you need to take a more deliberate approach. Gather insights, consult your team, and carefully consider long-term consequences. Remember, though, that even high-stakes decisions should not linger unnecessarily, as indecision can harm progress and morale.</p><h3 id="assessing-urgency-and-timing">Assessing Urgency and Timing</h3><p>Next, assess the urgency: Is an immediate decision necessary, or does waiting serve as a strategic move? In many cases, waiting can yield new insights that make the path forward clearer. Yet, there are situations where acting quickly brings greater advantages, helping you maintain momentum and prevent the team from getting bogged down in analysis paralysis. Striking this balance is essential&#x2014;moving too fast may result in oversights, while moving too slow could mean missed opportunities.</p><h3 id="importance-and-downstream-impact">Importance and Downstream Impact</h3><p>The simplest starting point in decision analysis is determining the level of importance and downstream impact. For minor, inconsequential items, a quick, instinctual choice might suffice. But if the decision involves irreversible steps or a significant investment of resources, take a pause. Again, ask yourself if more data might emerge or needs to be sought, or if you already have everything you&#x2019;re ever going to get. Lingering too long can become a bottleneck, fostering procrastination and preventing your team from taking bold, decisive action.</p><h3 id="when-your-team-is-split">When Your Team is Split</h3><p>Often, you&#x2019;ll encounter situations where your team is divided, with strong opinions on both sides. When no natural consensus emerges, the role of the leader is to step in and make the call with clarity and confidence. To do so effectively, communicate openly about the information you&#x2019;ve gathered, and walk your team through your thought process.</p><p>In these cases, the specific choice you make often matters less than the transparency you show in weighing all sides and explaining your rationale. A team doesn&#x2019;t need unanimous agreement to thrive. It simply needs clarity, a sense of direction, and the trust that open communication was respected throughout the process. In practice, it&#x2019;s often healthier for teams to embrace a &#x201C;test-and-learn&#x201D; mindset rather than rigid, top-down directives.</p><h3 id="the-collective-weight-of-decisions">The Collective Weight of Decisions</h3><p>Ultimately, a team&#x2019;s success hinges on the cumulative impact of its decisions. Focusing on the process of decision-making&#x2014;not just the decisions themselves&#x2014;is crucial. <em>A decision by a leader, when shared transparently, becomes a valuable artifact for the team&#x2019;s success. Obsessing over this process refining this as you primary craft as a leader can be the defining factor that shapes a team&#x2019;s trajectory.</em></p><p>So far, we&#x2019;ve explored some foundational considerations for making thoughtful choices. In future posts, I&#x2019;ll dive into various methods and techniques to enhance team decision-making. From basic pro-con lists and weighted matrices to creative approaches like Six Thinking Hats, these tools can help teams stay organized, objective, and collaborative, minimizing ego-driven pitfalls along the way.</p><p>Until then, remember: your decisions shape not only your future but the entire team&#x2019;s trajectory. Embrace the process, foster clarity, and build a foundation for intentional progress with each choice you make together.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Concept to Launch in 50 Days—Building SiteReviewDesk.ai]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Leaving the corporate world behind is both exhilarating and daunting.

In late June 2024, I made the hard decision to step away from my role as an Engineering Leader at Cisco. My goal? To dive headfirst and hands-on into the world of artificial intelligence and independently build a SaaS product from scratch.<strong>This is the story of how I brought </strong><a href="https://www.sitereviewdesk.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>sitereviewdesk.ai</strong></a><strong> to life in just 50 days.</strong>I share a sprint retrospective towards the bottom of this blog.<strong>Share on:</strong>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falvorithm.com%2Fblog%2Ff%2Ffrom-concept-to-launch-in-50-days%E2%80%94building-sitereviewdeskai&amp;title=From%20Concept%20to%20Launch%20in%2050%20Days%E2%80%94Building%20SiteReviewDesk.ai&amp;summary=Discover%20the%20journey%20of%20taking%20an%20idea%20from%20concept%20to%20launch%20in%2050%20days.%20Learn%20the%20process%2C%20challenges%2C%20and%20triumphs%20of%20building%20SiteReviewDesk.ai.&amp;source=AlvoRithm" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a></p><h3 id></h3><h3 id="the-need-for-speed-shifting-from-corporate-to-lean-execution">The Need for Speed: Shifting from Corporate to Lean Execution</h3><p>In the corporate environment, I found myself spending 80% or more of my time on meetings, status updates, and endless planning sessions. While coordination is essential in large organizations as a leader, it often leaves little room for actual personal tangible execution. I craved the agility of immediate decision-making and the thrill of rapid development.I aimed to invert my daily ratio to an extreme of 90% execution and 10% planning. This approach was inspired by the military&apos;s 2/3rd rule: spend one-third of the time planning and allocate the remaining two-thirds to execution. As an independent developer, this was not just possible&#x2014;it was imperative.  My challenge to myself and goal was to maximize learning and building with what I had left of summer 2024.  I had planned at the time to re-evaluate in late September on next-steps for me -- so that was my personal &quot;deadline&quot;.</p><h3 id="-1"></h3><h3 id="hands-on-learning-the-best-teacher">Hands-On Learning: The Best Teacher</h3><p>While I began with some courses from DeepLearning.ai, I have always preferred and know myself that I resonated more with hands-on application. That always seemed to stick better with me as I get into my 3rd decade of my career.  For me at least, building, tinkering, and even stumbling along the way provided insights that no lecture could offer.

Each day&apos;s batch of edits and rabbit holes can get gnarly, but just like a relationship with a spouse -- try to never go to bed upset or leaving things messy :).</li><li><strong>Establishing an AI Project Masterplan.md</strong>: Something I picked up from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bhancock_ai?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code with Brandon</a>&apos;s template <a href="https://github.com/bhancockio/claude-crash-course-templates?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> was invaluable as a way to build and maintain a sort of master project plan that you can maintain and give to any LLM for context on your project.  This is so you don&apos;t have to re-explain to LLMs over and over again what exactly you&apos;re doing and the context.  I just put this file in my Anthropic project file cache for example, or kept pointing to it in Cursor/VSCode for the LLMs to read first as a primer before answering and working on my code.</li><li><strong>Optimizing AI Tools:</strong> Making it a good habit to keep updating these system/agent prompt engineering and context documents frequently was good hygiene and significantly improved the efficiency using AI development tools. Files like the masterplan.md file, a db schema description file, project file folder structure explainer and README.md for the repo were key.  This all helped reduced the time spent on iterative messaging the LLMs and increased the quality of their outputs.</li><li><strong>Choosing the Right AI Tools:</strong> I found that <a href="https://www.cursor.com/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursor</a> outperformed VS Code with the <a href="https://www.continue.dev/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continue</a> extension for my needs. Additionally, <a href="https://ollama.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ollama</a> was fantastic for experimenting with different models locally without worrying about API costs.  During development I probably did 80% of LLM API calls using Ollama (Llama 3.1) and 20% on production paid models Gemini, GPT 4O, Sonnet 3.5 etc..</li></ul><h3 id="challenges-faced">Challenges Faced</h3><ul><li><strong>Tool Limitations:</strong> While using Anthropic&apos;s Project feature, I encountered issues with updating files. The inability to replace files with the same name led to confusion about which version the AI was referencing.  I notified Anthropic about this key functionality miss btw.  Maybe others have too!</li><li><strong>Platform Complexity:</strong> Running everything on Google Firebase and GCP was more convoluted than expected. The separate admin consoles and scattered documentation made navigation and troubleshooting time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Documentation Woes:</strong> Google&apos;s documentation was less user-friendly than I had hoped. I often resorted to using language models to find answers, which isn&apos;t ideal when you&apos;re deep in development.</li></ul><h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3><ul><li><strong>Avoid Manual Copy-Pasting:</strong> Early on, I wasted time manually transferring code snippets from AI chat windows. F**k that -- don&apos;t be like me and do that.  Switching to Cursor streamlined this process, integrating AI suggestions directly into my codebase.  That&apos;s one of the things they forked and implemented into their core editor with better fuzzy logic to inject lines of code more accurately.  Continue.dev with the limitations of being a VS Code extension didn&apos;t do as smooth of a job with this.  I haven&apos;t tried and done the latest track test with VS Code&apos;s latest releases to try and compete with Cursor on this.</li><li><strong>Select the Right Models:</strong> General-purpose models like Llama 3.1 didn&apos;t meet my coding needs. Specialized fine-tuned models like Codestral and paid models like GPT-4.0, and <strong>especially</strong> <strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong>, provided better coding performance.</li><li><strong>Tool Efficacy Matters:</strong> Cursor&apos;s intuitive integration of AI suggestions into live code made it superior to alternatives like Continue.dev, which was hit-or-miss in its effectiveness.  (But I did miss the &quot;/&lt;custom_command&gt;&quot;  function from Continue for common prompts you want to use with the LLM window &#x2013; Cursor should add that in!)</li></ul><h3 id="-2"></h3><h3 id="reflecting-on-the-journey">Reflecting on the Journey</h3><p>Looking back, the experience was everything I hoped it would be. Of course, there were lots of expected challenges and learnings, but they were just minor setbacks and actually valuable lessons that contributed to both personal and professional growth. While, I am certain I could have spent more time on upfront market research with this particular product, I believe that building something meaningful sometimes requires taking that leap of faith.</p><h3 id="-3"></h3><h3 id="moving-forward-whats-next">Moving Forward: What&apos;s Next?</h3><p>As I continue to iterate on <a href="https://sitereviewdesk.ai/?ref=localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitereviewdesk.ai,</a> I&apos;m diving into the realms of <strong>marketing</strong> and user acquisition&#x2014;a whole new world of learning and set of challenges.

Life was good, right? Well, it was... but if you&apos;re anything like me, an engineer at heart, something was missing over time. That spark, that fire in my belly that made me fall in love with tech 20+ years ago.So, I did what any rational person would do. <strong>I quit my job. &#x1F605;</strong>Crazy? Maybe. Exciting? Absolutely!  <strong>Let&apos;s talk about it...</strong><em>(Thanks for reading! &#x1F60A; I share all this openly with the hope that it helps <strong>you</strong> with your life and pursuits, both in work and your passion for your craft. May it offer at least one tech industry colleague&apos;s experience for your consideration.)</em>Share on  <strong>LinkedIn</strong> </p><h4 id="a-leap-of-faith">A Leap of Faith</h4><p></p><p>I worked at Cisco for about a decade since the acquisition of OpenDNS in 2015 - the hot security startup I had joined back then. Over the years, I gathered a ton of experience across several teams and roles, including Security Engineer, Network Engineer, Software Engineer, Technical Lead, and Senior Tech Lead.As I gained more seniority and leadership experience, I naturally moved into leadership roles and became part of the senior levels of Engineering Management, stepping in wherever our business needed me. I was fortunate to join, start, hire, and lead teams, working with a ton of smart, awesome people, and together we delivered on some impactful projects.My career in a big tech giant was going well, and the momentum of the business cycles was fulfilling. But deep down, perhaps like some of you in the industry reading this blog, I gradually found it more difficult to extricate myself from necessary but lengthy corporate processes, meetings, and management tasks. I longed to spend personal time on immediate hands-on exploration and building things directly.I loved my team, and fostering their teamwork and growth is something I will cherish forever. However, what was best for the team often trumped my desire to spend time coding and building directly. <strong>As it should, and I would pick them over me any day of the week.</strong>With my deep passion and obsession with the AI/ML explosion, I came to a realization. <strong>I needed a change to follow my heart and pursue more exploration into AI/ML adoption.</strong> I wanted to learn and develop directly, something I had been obsessed about lately.After discussing with my family and ensuring I could survive for several months, I made a hard decision and took a leap of faith. <strong>I decided to swing the pendulum back to being hands-on by taking 3-6 months away from a traditional &quot;day job&quot; to learn everything I could about AI/ML.</strong> I aimed to understand how to work with it, how to code with it, how to develop content and business strategies with it, and ultimately how to build a startup with it.Yes, call me crazy &#x1F61C;, but I&apos;m simultaneously juggling studying, coding, and building while maintaining my business and leadership skills through a solo-preneur startup project. <strong>Let&apos;s see how far and fast AI can take us as a force multiplier!</strong> &#x1F680;<em>(Spoiler alert: <strong>It&apos;s only been 3 weeks, and I&apos;ve never been more productive, excited, and focused.</strong> Working long and hard with new tooling and tech, co-developing and brainstorming with LLMs, this is a huge upgrade in personal satisfaction. Life&apos;s good &#x1F60A;.)</em></p><h4 id="discovering-alvorithm">Discovering AlvoRithm</h4><p></p><p>During this transition, I felt I needed a new face and brand to reinvent myself.  I&apos;ve decided on the <strong>AlvoRithm</strong>.  AlvoRithm will be a personal brand dedicated to sharing my journey, insights, and discoveries in AI. It&#x2019;s a play on words, combining my passions for music production, video content creation, and more. AlvoRithm is not just a platform for documenting my experiences; it&#x2019;s also a space where I aim to inspire and educate others who are passionate about technology and creativity.<strong>AlvoRithm&apos;s mission is to bridge the gap between AI theory and practical application, providing valuable insights to software developers, tech professionals, aspiring engineers, and anyone interested in the future of technology.</strong> Through blogs, vlogs, and social media, I share weekly updates in a Sprint retrospective style, highlighting what went well, what I learned, and areas for improvement.</p><h4 id="learning-and-growing">Learning and Growing</h4><p>My journey into AI has been incredibly enriching over the last three weeks. I&apos;m currently diving deep into Deep Learning Specialization courses from Coursera with Andrew Ng from Stanford University. These courses provide a solid theoretical foundation and practical skills essential for navigating the AI landscape.In parallel, I&apos;m working on a startup idea that leverages AI to create innovative solutions. This hands-on project allows me to experiment with the latest LLM models, cutting-edge techniques, and applications for software development. It&apos;s an exhilarating process that combines creativity, technical expertise, and a passion for problem-solving.</p><h4 id="sharing-knowledge">Sharing Knowledge</h4><p>One of my core beliefs is that knowledge should be shared. Through AlvoRithm, I aim to distill complex AI concepts into easily digestible content. My goal is to save you time and provide you with the most valuable insights from a seasoned tech industry professional.I can start with going over what I believe every tech enthusiast should explore in order:</p><ol><li><strong>Conversational AI</strong>: Engage with chat models like OpenAI&apos;s GPT-4 or Anthropic&apos;s Claude.</li><li><strong>Image Generation</strong>: Experiment with tools like DALL-E, Midjourney for generating images or equivalent.</li><li><strong>Foundational Concepts</strong>: Understand key AI terms and concepts (e.g. LLMs, Supervised, Unsupervised, Parameters, Quantization, Fine-Tuning, context-windows, temperature, RAG, multi-modal, agents.</li><li><strong>Coding Assistants</strong>: Integrate the latest code workflow enhancing tools (e.g. Github CoPilot, Agentic Frameworks like Crew.ai or Autogen).</li><li><strong>Local Hosting</strong>: Explore local LLM hosting alternatives and open-source models.</li><li><strong>Popular Models</strong>: Try out various open-source models (e.g. LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma 2) vs paid models (ChatGPT, Claude)</li></ol><h4 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h4><p>As I continue this exciting journey, I&apos;m committed to launching at least one new startup around September, centered around an AI-based application I&apos;m passionate about and I&apos;ll be using AI itself to help accelerate and implement the service. AlvoRithm will be the hub where I share every step of this journey, offering insights, lessons learned, and inspiration to my audience.</p><h4 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h4><p>If you&apos;re intrigued by my journey and want to stay updated and keep in touch on the latest in AI, tech, and creative content, I invite you to follow me:- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvinswong/- YouTube: AlvoRithm - YouTube channel - X.com (Twitter) - @theAlvoRithmLet&apos;s explore together!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhiteHorse 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2501" srcset="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 1000w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 1600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">WhiteHorse 2022 - Aurora Borealis</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2500" srcset="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 1000w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 1600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">WhiteHorse 2022 - Aurora Borealis Lights</span></figcaption></figure>]]></description><link>https://alvorithm.com/whitehorse-2022/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6715c3b1c64fbe207d109497</guid><category><![CDATA[Photography]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alvin Wong]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:16:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---2022.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---2022.jpg" alt="WhiteHorse 2022"><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="WhiteHorse 2022" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2501" srcset="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 1000w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 1600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">WhiteHorse 2022 - Aurora Borealis</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="WhiteHorse 2022" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2500" srcset="https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 1000w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 1600w, https://alvorithm.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/WhiteHorse---Aurora.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">WhiteHorse 2022 - Aurora Borealis Lights</span></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
